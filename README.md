Succinct data structures and other libraries by Piotr Beling for Rust, including:
- `minimum_redundancy` ([crate](https://crates.io/crates/minimum_redundancy), [doc](https://docs.rs/minimum_redundancy/)) -  encode and decode data
  with binary or non-binary Huffman coding;
- `fsum` ([crate](https://crates.io/crates/fsum), [doc](https://docs.rs/fsum/)) - calculate accurate sum of floats;
- `dyn_size_of` ([crate](https://crates.io/crates/dyn_size_of), [doc](https://docs.rs/dyn_size_of/)) - report approximate amount of memory consumed by variables, including the memory allocated on heap.
